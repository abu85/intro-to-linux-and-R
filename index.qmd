Welcome to the Day1 (2025-10-06)


## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of the day1, participants will be able to:

*Unix/Linux*

1. Describe CLI, Linux shell, tools
1. **Install and verify** the functionality of key **genomics tools**: `Plink`, `vcftools`, `BCFtools`, and `Bedtools`.
1. **Navigate the Unix/Linux environment**, including creating directories, moving between locations, and managing files.

*R* 

1. **Install and load essential R packages** for genomic analysis: `GAPIT3`, `ggplot2`, and `rrBLUP`.
1. Set working directories
1. **Load and explore data in R**, including reading tables and data frames.

## Learning Activities

To achieve the above outcomes, participants will:

*Unix/Linux:* 

1. Read Linux, CLI, Shell materials (pre-course materials, 1st meeting).
1. Follow guided installation steps for Plink, vcftools, BCFtools, and Bedtools on their systems (pre-course, 1st meeting).
1. Run basic Unix commands to create directories, navigate folders, and manage files (1st meeting).

*R:*

1. Read and follow R & RStudio materials
1. Explore data structure, set working directories(pre-course, 1st meeting).
1. Install R packages and verify functionality by loading them in R(1st meeting).
1. Load data into R, inspect it using both from RStudio and by functions (1st meeting).


## 🧰 `Before Day 1`
Read the `pre-course` ⬆️ and install `R`, `RStudio Desktop` (all users) and `Linux/Ubuntu` (windows users only), and be prepared accordingly. 

We will need following `tools` in the day 1:

cd intro-to-linux-and-R   # change and enter into the folder(directory)
```

Or Clone this repository (only if you have git tool in linux):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intro-to-R-genomic-selection.git
cd intro-to-linux-and-R
```

#### 📚 Contents of the 📁 **intro-to-linux-and-R**

```bash
ls -la         # see the content through linux
```
It will be look like as follows
