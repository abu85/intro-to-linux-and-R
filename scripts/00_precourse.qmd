## Precourse materials

Install or activate **WSL or Unix**, and install **R and RStudio if you do not have them already before 1st meeting**.

We strongly recommend for **those not yet familiar with UNIX and/or R to take this opportunity and take these online tutorials**, since those are requirements for the workshop. This will help you to develop your programming skills and we can always learn a few tricks here and there, even if you are already experienced.
