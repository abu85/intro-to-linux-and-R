## Precourse materials

Before 1st meeting, please Install or activate **WSL or Unix** (mac users do not need this part), and install **R and RStudio if you do not have them already**.

We strongly recommend for **those not yet familiar with UNIX and/or R to take this opportunity and take the following online tutorials**, since those are pre-requisite for the workshop *but not mandatory*. This will help you to develop your programming skills and we can always learn a few tricks here and there, even if you are already experienced.

### `Before 1st meeting`: *Make sure you have activated Unix, R, RStudio in your PC*
