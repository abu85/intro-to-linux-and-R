## Precourse materials

Install or activate WSL Unix, and **install R and RStudio if you do not have them already before 1st meeting**.

We strongly recommend for **those not yet familiar with UNIX and/or R to take this opportunity and take these online tutorials**, since those are requirements for the workshop. This will help you to develop your programming skills and we can always learn a few tricks here and there, even if you are already experienced.

#### `Before 1st meeting`: Make sure you have all tools in your PC
